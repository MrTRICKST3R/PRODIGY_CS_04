Keylogger

Introduction
This keylogger tool is designed to capture keystrokes from the keyboard. It runs in the background and records all keys pressed by the user, including letters, numbers, and special characters. The captured keystrokes are logged to a file named "keylog.txt".

Usage
The keylogger starts automatically upon running the script. It silently captures keystrokes in the background. Press the 'Esc' key to stop the keylogging process and save the captured keystrokes to the "keylog.txt" file.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pynput

Installation
1. Install Python 3.x from python.org
2. Install the pynput library using pip: pip install pynput

Usage
1. Save the script to a file (e.g., keylogger.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using Python: python keylogger.py
